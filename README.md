## Structure
The backend is a NodeJS app using Express and Prisma/Planetscale for the database.
The frontend is a React Native application for iOS and Android.

# Backend setup
## Store your environment variables
1. Copy the `example.env` file.
2. Rename it to `.env`. Any filed named `.env` will be ignored by git. It is a good place to store API keys and Bearer Tokens which should never added to git.
3. Save your variables in the `.env` file. Common usage is to store the key in all-caps
4. Inside the app, if you need to use an environment variable, replace it with `process.env.<VARIABLE_NAME>`, e.g. `process.env.PORT`
